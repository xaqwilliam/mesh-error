Main error:  
Run:  
`make start_db`  
`make seed`  
`yarn build`  
See error "Unable to write file"

Less important but still annoying error:  
Then, remove "old." from the tsconfig.json file  
See error "Option 'module' must be set to 'NodeNext' when option 'moduleResolution' is set to 'NodeNext'"  
When both of those settings are correct
